  - Maybe: replace code that loads icons from embedded resources with code
    to load them from files (and update Makefile to no longer link in icons).

    Context: originally I designed the code so that icon files get linked into
    the binary (see icons.o and "ld -r -b binary" in the Makefile), which is
    convenient because it makes it unnecessary to install the icons separately,
    and makes it easy to find them at runtime without knowing the installation
    path.

    However, libappindicator doesn't support this. It requires an absolute path
    to an icon file in PNG format, which requires installing those files
    explicitly. Consequently, the icons are currently included twice: both as
    individual files in the /usr/share/loot/icons/ directory, and linked into
    the /usr/bin/loot binary. This is clearly redundant. It might make sense to
    simplify the situation by loading icons from files in the main binary too.
